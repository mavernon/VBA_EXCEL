# VBA_EXCEL
Overview:

This is a simple project that was created ~ 2005. Its purpose was to create a gui for Excel worksheets
that would add convenience (since it would open automatically when the worksheet was opened), as well as,
expedite data input, and provide a user-friendly interface for general data management.

Note: You must enable macros in your Excel software, in order to run this program (in a Microsoft Windows environment of course).


Operation:

A VBA graphical user interface opens immediately when the Excel file is executed.
Select any one of four buttons on the entry form's interface to begin a form event
(note: Do NOT close the Excel workbok behind the form).
Select the Close Application button on the main entry form to close the application completely.


Gain access to the VBA code editor, to view the form application's VBA codes:

 1. From the main entry form, select the X icon at the top-right corner of the entry form to close it.

 2. Select the view tab on the main menu (of the workbook interface that remains ...).

 3. Select the view Macro's icon (from the extended View menu).

 4. When the Macro dialog box opens, choose the Edit button.

 5. Minimize (but do not close) the complete Excel Workbook view in order to view the VBA code editor.


To review the form application's VBA code, from the VBA code editor:

 1. If Project Explorer is not visible at the left-side of the code editor, select View > Project Explorer.

 2. Expand the Forms folder in Project Explorer, then right-click any of the forms, and select View Code.
